üìñ **Navigation**: [‚Üê Main README](../README.md) | [Technical Overview](TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md) | [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md)

## Overview
This dataset contains comprehensive employee activity monitoring data designed for behavioral analysis and anomaly detection in organizational security contexts. The dataset tracks multiple dimensions of employee behavior including printing activities, file burning operations, travel patterns, and access control events.

## Dataset Structure

### Core Entity
- **Primary Key**: `employee_id` + `date`
- **Total Fields**: 49 fields covering employee properties, activities, and risk indicators
- **Temporal Coverage**: Complete date range for all employees (including days with no activity)
- **Purpose**: Machine learning models learn from both presence and absence of activities

- **Friday**: Starting from 16:00
- **Saturday**: All day
- **Weekend**: Friday 16:00 through Saturday

### Night Hours Definition
- **22:00-05:00** for access control purposes

## Risk Assessment Framework

### High-Risk Scenarios

### Senior Employee Risk Factors
Senior employees (high `employee_seniority_years`) present unique risks:
- **Accumulated Privileges**: Higher access levels over time
- **System Knowledge**: Understanding of security bypasses
- **Behavioral Changes**: Sudden pattern changes more suspicious
- **Department-Specific Risks**: Executive Management and R&D pose highest insider threat potential
- **Position-Based Access**: C-level executives and department heads have broader system access

#### Travel-Related Risks
The `risk_travel_indicator` is triggered by multiple factors including:
- Unofficial travel to hostile countries
- Data operations during personal travel
- Country hostility level assessments
- Combination of travel and suspicious activities

**Key Risk Scenarios**:
1. **Information Leakage**: Employee collaboration with external parties
2. **Identity Theft**: Unauthorized use of credentials while employee is abroad
3. **Graduated Risk Assessment**: `hostility_country_level` enables nuanced threat evaluation

### Behavioral Anomalies

#### Color Printing Patterns
- Color printing often indicates special document types:
  - Marketing materials
  - Official forms
  - Graphical reports
  - Architectural plans
- Unusual color printing by typically B&W users may signal suspicious activity

### Cross-Campus Activities
- **Printing from other locations**: `printed_from_other` flag and `print_campuses` list
- **Burning from other locations**: `burned_from_other` flag and `burn_campuses` list
- Access patterns inconsistent with job role

#### Enhanced Country Risk Assessment
- **Hostility levels**: `hostility_country_level` provides granular risk classification
- **Travel risk combinations**: Multiple factors determine `risk_travel_indicator`

#### Malicious Activity Detection
- **Individual indicators**: `is_malicious` flags specific incidents
- **Employee-level assessment**: `is_emp_malicious` provides overall employee risk rating
